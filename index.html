                  <hr>
                  <p>We repair EUR pallets for most major companies in the Gothenburg area. 
                    In total, this is about 15,000 pallets/month. We are licensed by SIS/DNV and this gives us permission to carry out repairs on EUR pallets.
                     This also means that our repairs are checked by DNV, all to maintain the high standard we are known for. 
                     Our license number is A-74.

              <hr>
              <p>
                More and more companies hire us to sort pallets that are going to the pallet depot. 
                Since we are constantly updated on current regulations, this guarantees a correct result.
                After sorting, the pallets are delivered according to the customer's wishes, for example to DHL's or BTL's depots. 
            
                The pallets that are not approved are taken back by the customer or repaired by us. 
               It will be efficient and rational management with "the right man in the right place". 
               We also have the opportunity to train our customers' staff in pallet sorting according to current regulations.

              <hr>
              <p>We manufacture all types of wooden packaging, for example hedges and special pallets. 
                Export boxes in all formats are our specialty, all according to the customer's wishes. 
                If you have something that needs packaging, standard size or special, don't hesitate to contact us. 
                Of course, we are covered by producer responsibility, which means that you as a customer can trust our packaging.
                We are licensed by the Swedish Agricultural Agency for the manufacture of heat-treated packaging for export to all corners of the world, 
                for example China, Australia and the USA. 
                Our IPPC license is SE-O-3755. The license means that we heat the wood to 56 degrees for 30 minutes. The license guarantees that the wood does not contain vermin and that pests cannot spread around the world.
