## Design

### wierframes
I created wierframes from balsamic to visualize what I wanted the finished design to look like. I started creating wierframes for
 mobile devices first because I wanted to stick with the mobile-first approach, then I created wierframes for tablet and computer screen sizes.

## Deployment
### SETTING IT UP
I used Code Institute's instructional video on how to deploy my website. I paused the video and followed the instructions. Text and steps below are copied from Code Institutes instructions on how to deploy the site to GitHub.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically     refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found here - https://linnea87.github.io/Pallmaster-AB/
