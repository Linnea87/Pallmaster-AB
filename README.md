## Design

### wierframes
I created wierframes from balsamic to visualize what I wanted the finished design to look like. I started creating wierframes for
 mobile devices first because I wanted to stick with the mobile-first approach, then I created wierframes for tablet and computer screen sizes.

### The index page
During the process I changed the design on the index page as I thought that the one I drew/planned didn't turn out well in reality.

### color
When it came to choosing colors for the website, I wanted the colors to go in the beige/brown direction, which creates a red thread to the website's content. To achieve this I used https://coolors.co to create these "wood colors".

## Deployment
### SETTING IT UP
I used Code Institute's instructional video on how to deploy my website. I paused the video and followed the instructions. Text and steps below are copied from Code Institutes instructions on how to deploy the site to GitHub.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically     refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found here - https://linnea87.github.io/Pallmaster-AB/

### Adding, committing and pushing code

## Testing

* Manually tested all navigation links on every page.
* Manually tested opening the site in different browsers.
* Tested to skip filling in the contact form - submit button did not work until I filled in the information properly, hence the 'required' attribute is working.
* Came to the page 'submit.html' when filling in Contact Form and clicking on Submit.
* Gallery - all images are showing and gallery is flexible depending on screen size.
